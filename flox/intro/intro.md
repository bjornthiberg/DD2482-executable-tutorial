Welcome!

Today we are going to go through an interactive tutorial about Flox, a virtual environment and package manager. 

Specifically, we are going to:
- Install Flox
- Create a Flox environment
- Search for and install Flox packages
- Learn how a Flox environment is structured
- Use environment variables in Flox
- Set up a service to run with our environment

And all in a day's work. 

This tutorial should require minimal prior knowledge.

Let's get started!
